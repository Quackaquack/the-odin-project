        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>This is someone's mom's special homemade lasagna. 
            It uses a made-from-scratch tomato sauce, which is apparently noteworthy if you're an American.
            There's also cheese in the filling made from cottage cheese and parmesan instead of the (apparently) traditional ricotta.
            They sounded confident enough, so let's just take their word for it.
            According to the author, <em>this is the best lasagna recipe ever made.</em>
            I don't know about you, but that seems like quite the claim. Eh, who cares. This is just a silly little beginner's project anyway.

        <h3>How long to cook lasagna</h3>
        <p>In an oven preheated to 375 degrees F, this homemade lasagna should be perfectly baked 
            in about 50 minutes (30-40 minutes covered, 5-10 minutes uncovered).</p>
        <p>Yeah, I know. This recipe is bullshit. I'm not going to try to fix it any more than I already have.</p>
